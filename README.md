## Web mail client implemented with Angular
- This project implements a web mail client using Angular UI Framework, to send and recieve emails.
- It is created by following along the following [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/102zPc3@UJQf10EV-1bwIF3-KNfxrJSIteSoWdjAfWHTagysBsjtTRDQ_IK4sa2flsT1f4If/)
- The email server was provided by the course instructor, to create email accounts with user names ending in `@angular-email.com`
- It demonstrates important features in any enterprise application - Authentication (Sign Up, Sign In, Redirecting user back to sign in when not authenticated, Displaying email content as well as API integration to send and recieve emails)
- It uses Semantic UI library for CSS.


## To-Dos or future plans
- I plan on implementing my own server, either mock or an actual email server to make it a full stack application
- I want to implement more features to make this into a real application
  - forgot password flow, Gmail / Github Authentication integration
  - Grouping Recieved emails (Unread, Important, Custom Labels)
